<h1>Django, Web Framework</h1>
<p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.</p>

<p>The project was started in 2003 by developers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper. It was released as an open-source project in 2005.</p>

<p>Django is named after Django Reinhardt, a famous jazz guitarist.</p>

<p>Since then, Django has become one of the most widely used web frameworks in the Python ecosystem, appreciated for its built-in admin panel, ORM, template system, and strong security features.</p>
